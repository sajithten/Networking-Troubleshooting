when are u facing issue?

get destination url - check ns lookup - if not resolved - need to move to proxy team, if it is resolving need to ask how many user impacted, take 1 ip address which is not happening and take  ip address check on splunk, if firewall is blocking the traffic then ask SM to move ticket to security team

If url resolving then take ip address, put it in netbrain and check switch if flapping or not

if dest url not reachable from user laptop for eg 3.59.237.45:8585, then check if user able to telnet to destinaton on port 443, if yes, then it need to be check by application team, because it is already permitted in firewall
