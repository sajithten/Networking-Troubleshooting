Alert wise ticket gets memory issue or VIP down

1. for memory issue: in f5 gui > statistics > Memory > 
2. for VIP down issue(virtual servers): Local Traffic >  Virtual servers (VIP IP will be the destination IP for user to reach to the server under virtual server(VIP)
3. for Pool Member down: click the particular VIP > Resources note the Pool name > Pools > Pool List > click Pool name > Members > we see the physical servers
4. To check the logs: system > Logs > Local Traffic , will give any VIP down alerts, pool member down alert
5. Rare cases everything is up but still user facing issue accessing server, such cases we apply Packet capture on F5 by using tcp dump command
6. if user saying not able to access particular url: search url resolved IP on netbrain > go to one-IP table > take f5 in description > login to f5 > virtual servers > Virtual Server List > search for ip add > is there VIP > inside there pool members where actual application hosted.
